# RedBlackTreeProject

This python script parses the words of a given input text file, places them in a RedBlack Tree structure, and ultimately outputs the words in an orderly fashion, to an `output.txt` file.

The repository provides a sample text file "war_and_peace.txt" to try out. The code has only been tested with python3.10, but it should be compatible with other python3 versions (:, it requires no additional python packages.

Usage:
`python3 main.py war_and_peace.txt`
